Hi, I am Yunqiao. I am now studying for phd in Harbin Institute of Technology, and I studied in Harbin Institute of Technology (Weihai) and Beijing Institute of Technology before. And I worked as an engineer in CETC and NAURA a few years ago.

I feel pleased to discuss with you in infrared image imaging and procesing research and we can get progress together. 

Please use this code to put in the code series of DNANET for more performance test and comparable work. Thanks very much for the author Boyang Li to open this network and framework. https://github.com/YeRen123455/Infrared-Small-Target-Detection.
